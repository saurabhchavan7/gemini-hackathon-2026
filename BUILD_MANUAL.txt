MANUAL .EXE BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

STEP 1: DELETE OLD BUILD FILES
========================================

Open Command Prompt (CMD) and run:

cd "d:\SAURABH\spring 2024\git-workspace\gemini-hackathon-2026\DeskApp"

rmdir /s /q dist
rmdir /s /q .next
rmdir /s /q out

(If folders don't exist, that's fine)


STEP 2: BUILD NEXT.JS FRONTEND
========================================

In CMD, run:

npm run build

Wait for it to finish. You should see:
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages
Routes created with no errors


STEP 3: BUILD THE ELECTRON .EXE
========================================

In CMD, run this EXACT command:

set CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false && npx electron-builder --win --publish never

This will take 2-5 minutes. Watch for:
- "packaging platform=win32"
- "dist/win-unpacked" - this is the folder being created
- At the end you should see success messages


STEP 4: FIND YOUR .EXE FILES
========================================

After build completes, check:

dir dist\win-unpacked\LifeOS.exe

This checks if LifeOS.exe was created (it should be ~200+ MB)


STEP 5: TEST THE .EXE
========================================

In CMD, run:

"d:\SAURABH\spring 2024\git-workspace\gemini-hackathon-2026\DeskApp\dist\win-unpacked\LifeOS.exe"

Or just navigate to:
d:\SAURABH\spring 2024\git-workspace\gemini-hackathon-2026\DeskApp\dist\win-unpacked\

And double-click LifeOS.exe


STEP 6: COPY TO DIST ROOT (FOR EASY SHARING)
========================================

If everything works, copy the final .exe:

copy "d:\SAURABH\spring 2024\git-workspace\gemini-hackathon-2026\DeskApp\dist\win-unpacked\LifeOS.exe" "d:\SAURABH\spring 2024\git-workspace\gemini-hackathon-2026\DeskApp\dist\Mnemos.exe"

Then verify:

dir "d:\SAURABH\spring 2024\git-workspace\gemini-hackathon-2026\DeskApp\dist\Mnemos.exe"

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING DURING BUILD
========================================

If you see errors during Step 2 (npm run build):
- Error about TypeScript: This is normal - we fixed these already
- Keep going - if it says "Compiled successfully" at the end, you're good

If you see errors during Step 3 (electron-builder):
- Errors about "Cannot create symbolic link" for darwin files: SAFE TO IGNORE
- Errors about "winCodeSign": These are expected (trying to code-sign)
- What matters: "dist/win-unpacked" folder gets created with LifeOS.exe

If LifeOS.exe exists but won't open:
- Check: Is backend running? (https://lifeos-backend-1056690364460.us-central1.run.app)
- Try: Running as Administrator
- Try: Right-click → Open with → Default app

========================================
EXPECTED OUTPUT PATTERNS
========================================

GOOD - You should see:
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages
● electron-builder version=26.4.0
● packaging
● updating asar

BAD - You should NOT see:
Failed to compile
Build error
Cannot find

========================================
GO AHEAD AND RUN THESE COMMANDS!
========================================

Start with Step 1 and let me know:
1. If you hit any errors, paste the full error message
2. When LifeOS.exe is created, tell me
3. If it opens when you double-click it

Then I can help if anything goes wrong!
